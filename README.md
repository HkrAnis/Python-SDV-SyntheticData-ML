# Python-SDV-SyntheticData-ML
## Evaluate the performance of 9 machine learning models when trained on SDV generated synthetic data and testing it on the original data.
*From the book Hands-on machine learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow by O'Reilly.*

### Context
The [Synthetic Data Vault](https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/index.html) created an API that allows its users to generate synthetic data with python. The goal of this github repo is to evaluate how well machine learning models that are trained on synthetic data evalute when tested on the test set of the original data. Several synthetic data generators are evaluated each with 2 different sampels in order to train 9 different machine learning models in order to test the above goal.
